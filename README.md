# Wolt delivery fee calculator

This app is a frontend Wolt delivery fee calculator : "This code is needed when a customer is ready with their shopping cart and weâ€™d like to show them how much the delivery will cost. The delivery price depends on the cart value, the number of items in the cart, the time of the order, and the delivery distance."/Wolt, Github

Created with Vite+React+Typescript, node v20.1.0 & npm v9.6.4. 

This is also my first project with Typescript.

## Install

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. 

Commands:
Install dependencies: `npm install`

Run app: `npm run dev`
Click open the localhost-adress in the terminal. 

If you run into trouble with node/npm:
if your version is different (check with `node -v`), change to `nvm use 20.1.0`.

## Future development

Due to time constraints, the app is not yet foolproof. Following areas need to be fixed in the future:
- There needs to be more precise checks of the form inputs
- Higher test coverage
- Divide larger files to smaller components & functions
